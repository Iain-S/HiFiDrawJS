HIGH-LEVEL STEPS
1. Create version with flowchart.js:
   - Any number of sources and any number of destinations
   - May not be able to handle loops
   - Linkeable (or downloadable, at least)
   - Some tests
   - Some custom graphics for sources, amps and speakers
   - Different connectors
   - Analytics

2. Improve flowchart.js version
   - Handle loops (mics, etc.) and branches better
   - Add better connectors (maybe XLR images)    

FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS
- Add lists of existing components to source and destination drop-down menus
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Connection should have a remove button
- Add high-level svg functions (create window, add component, link component)
- Add lower-level svg functions (redraw, move, create_box, draw_arrow, etc.)
- Add repositioning support (i.e. draggable svg items)
- Add export support
- Improve visuals
- Add google analytics
- Set up Django server (in which case add test cases)?
- Add advertisements?
- Buy domain
- Add to github
- Move to jQuery ++
- Add list of connector types (RCA, TRS, XLR, speaker cable, wireless) ++
